# ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development Process
This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools, which contributed to approximately 50-60% of the initial setup and boilerplate code. The core logic, integration, debugging, and refinement were performed manually.

How AI Tools Were Used:
Vercel v0:

Used to generate the initial static layout and visual structure of the frontend dashboard based on a detailed prompt. This provided the foundational JSX and Tailwind CSS classes for the UI components.

Gemini & ChatGPT:

Conceptual Guidance: Provided high-level guidance on project structure, state management patterns, and deployment strategies.

Boilerplate Generation: Generated the initial file structure for the Node.js Express server and the basic API endpoint functions.

Targeted Debugging: Assisted in identifying and suggesting fixes for specific errors encountered during development, such as Cannot find module dependency issues and TypeError exceptions in JavaScript logic.

Code Snippets: Provided example code for specific tasks, like setting up fetch requests in React or configuring vite.config.js.

My Manual Contributions & Development Work:
While AI provided a significant head start, the following critical aspects were engineered and implemented manually:

Backend Logic: I wrote the core data calculation logic within the Express API for computing metrics like value, gainLoss, gainLossPercent, and portfolio allocation percentages from the raw data.

Full-Stack Integration: I was solely responsible for connecting the static frontend UI to the backend API. This involved writing all the fetch requests, managing component state with useState and useEffect hooks, and handling loading and error states for a smooth user experience.

Data Transformation: I developed the crucial logic to transform the data structures returned by the API into the specific formats required by the frontend charting library (Recharts), particularly converting JSON objects into arrays.

Debugging & Configuration: I personally diagnosed and resolved numerous issues, including:

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors between the frontend and backend.

Missing dependency errors (react-router-dom, etc.).

TypeScript path alias configuration issues in tsconfig.json to make @/ imports work correctly.

Refactoring and cleaning up AI-generated code to fit the project's specific needs.

Deployment: I manually configured and deployed both the backend and frontend applications on Render and Vercel, including setting up root directories and managing production environment variables to link the two services.
